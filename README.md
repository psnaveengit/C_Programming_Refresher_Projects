This Repo Tracks my Learning Progress for my Refresher on C Programming. T
he Repo collects learnings and projects from C Masterclass Udemy Course & The C Programming Language Book.

The "Learn" Folder Consists of 2 Subfolders, one for the online course and the other for the book

Similarly, the Projects folders consists of 2 Subfolders, one for the examples question in the book and the
other for the project assignment in the online course.

I used VS Code and installed extensions for C/C++ from Microsoft. To ease the running of code I installed 
"Code Runner" Extension by Jun Han. Ofcourse I already installed MinGW gcc C compiler.
