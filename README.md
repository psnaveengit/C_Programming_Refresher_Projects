This Repo Tracks my Learning Progress for my Refresher on C Programming. 
The Repo collects learnings and projects from C Masterclass Udemy Course.

The "Learn" Folder Consists of leanings of online course.

Similarly, the Projects folders consists of project assignments in the online course.

I used VS Code and installed extensions for C/C++ from Microsoft. 
To ease the running of code I installed "Code Runner" Extension by Jun Han. Ofcourse I already installed MinGW gcc C compiler.
To easily run compiled code I installed .exe runner too on VS Code.

NOTE: Delete the .vscode folder once cloned to your local drive to avoid errors in VS Code
